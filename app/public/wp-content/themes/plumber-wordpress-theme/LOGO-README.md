3. Select "Built-in White SVG Logo" or "Built-in Dark SVG Logo"
4. Click "Update Logo Settings"

### Option 2: Upload Custom Logos

## SVG Requirements

For best results, your SVG logos should:

### Custom Uploaded Logos

### Text Logo

- Good fallback option

## Managing Your Logos

### Admin Interface

### File Replacement
To replace the built-in SVG logos:
